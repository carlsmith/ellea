# Santa Ellea: Rulebook

Santa Ellea is inspired by Settlers of Catan, but is its own game, with its
own rules, described below.

The board is made from hexagonal tiles of eight types:

* Desert: Unproductive null tile.
* Meadow: Produces wood (for building).
* Quarry: Produces bricks (for building).
* Pasture: Produces meat (for feading troops).
* Cornfield: Produces corn (for feeding troops).
* Mountain: Produces diamonds (for raising funds).
* Shallow Sea: Unproductive, but can host harbors and ports.
* Deep Sea: Unproductive, and cannot host anything.

Note the five resource types (wood, bricks, meat, corn, diamonds).
